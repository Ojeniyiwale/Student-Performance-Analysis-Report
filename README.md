📊 Overview
This project investigates the relationships between student performance and various demographic and academic factors. By analyzing test scores across different subject areas and their correlations with socioeconomic indicators, we aim to identify key factors influencing academic achievement and provide actionable recommendations for educators and policymakers.
🎯 Key Objectives

Identify significant correlations between student performance and demographic/socioeconomic factors
Examine the impact of parental education level, economic status, and test preparation on academic outcomes
Analyze gender-based performance differences across subject areas
Provide evidence-based recommendations for targeted educational interventions

📋 Dataset
The analysis utilizes a dataset containing information on 1,000 students, including:
Independent Variables:

Gender
Race/ethnicity
Parental level of education
Lunch type (as a socioeconomic indicator)
Test preparation course completion

Dependent Variables:

Impact of Socioeconomic Factors

Parental Education: Students whose parents completed higher education consistently achieved better scores across all subjects
Economic Status: Students receiving standard lunch scored 104.52% higher on average than those with free/reduced lunch
Test Preparation: Students who completed test preparation courses outperformed non-participants by 7.23% across subjects

📝 Recommendations
Based on our findings, we recommend:

Gender-Specific Interventions: Targeted math support for female students and reading/writing enhancement for male students
Socioeconomic Support: Expanded access to educational resources for disadvantaged students
Nutritional Programs: Expanded free/subsidized lunch programs
Test Preparation Integration: Incorporation of test preparation strategies into standard curricula
Comprehensive Support: Personalized learning plans based on individual student needs
